        <h3>Welcome every hacker at this year's Wargame!</h3>
        <p>Every new stage is unlocked by solving 3 challenges on the previous stage. The solution of every assignment is a 32 characters long MD5 hash wrapped into "SECURITEAM{...}" (e.g. "SECURITEAM{0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef}"). If you find the hash without the pre- and postfixes, then you should wrap it in yourself.</p>
        <p>The hint button gives you some help but will halve the score of the challenge.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To reach the *.wargame sites, see the instructions in the VPN menu.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center">There are more challenges, too!</h3>
        <p>As this game is co-organized by the Hackerspace Szeged, you can solve multiple challenges created by them. <b>The ones marked with #HackespaceSzeged# do NOT use our flag format!</b></p>
